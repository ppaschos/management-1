Current Executive Team members: Frank W\u00fcrthwein, University of California San Diego, OSG Executive Director Miron Livny, University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison, OSG Technical Director and PI Brian Bockelman, Morgridge Institute for Research, OSG Technology lead Eric Lan\u00e7on, Brookhaven National Laboratory, BNL/ATLAS representative J\u00e9r\u00f4me Lauret, Brookhaven National Laboratory, Nuclear Physics representative Josh Drake, Indiana University, OSG Information Security Officer Ken Bloom, University of Nebraska\u2013Lincoln, Past OSG Council Chair and resource provider Lauren Michael, University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison, OSG Researcher Facilitation lead Lisa Goodenough, Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, Fermilab representative Mark Neubauer, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, OSG Resource Manager Rob Gardner, University of Chicago, OSG Collaboration Support lead and OSG Council chair Tim Cartwright, University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison, OSG Deputy Executive Director Management Activities \u00b6 Major activities of OSG management teams include: An annual planning retreat. At this two-day meeting near the start of each fiscal year, strategies, goals, and plans for the coming year and beyond are reviewed, discussed, debated, and settled on. A work-breakdown structure (WBS). Stemming from the annual planning retreat and maintained throughout the year is a standard WBS of high-level goals and objectives, including deliverables and milestones. The Area Coordinators report progress on and update the WBS documents periodically, and the OSG Executive team is responsible for the management and supervision of the WBS throughout the year. OSG Council meetings. These are scheduled quarterly (two per year in person, two by conference call) and generally include reviews of all OSG areas and goals, as well as any other reports the Council requests. Council members provide long-term strategy and supervision of the OSG Project and its management team, including election of the Executive Director. OSG Executive Team meetings. The team meets weekly to check in on key projects and discuss particular challenges. OSG Area Coordinator meetings. Also weekly, one or two Area Coordinators present on recent accomplishments, update the group on the status of WBS goals, and discuss current or foreseeable challenges. Because every OSG functional area is represented, this is a great venue to discuss cross-area issues.
